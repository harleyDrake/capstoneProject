Github repo for ST1 Capstone project for Harley Drake (u3144550)

In order to get this working properly, you will need to either set up a virtual environment with the venv command or download the following dependencies

1) django
2) plotly

the project is fairly straight forward, enjoy learning about video game sales :)
